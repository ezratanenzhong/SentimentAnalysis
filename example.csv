terribly rude when I was missing an item and was hoping it would get resolved right away. I guess I have a different vision of customer service. but will definitely never shop here again.
"The website is horrible. The personal customization does not work at check out!
I paid with PayPal, I paid with Mastercard.
Both authorizations were deducted from my account and then subsequently refunded."
Thank you Amazon! I think people take for granted orders and deliveries and how much logistics is involved. Considering how close we are to Christmas and still able to get deliveries for next day and returns are so easy and no quibble. Thanks to all the staff at Amazon and hope you all enjoy your festive season too!
Horrible customer service! Person on customer service chat was not knowledgeable and was just rude. Not buying anymore Converse.
"What's Not too love! Order, delivered to the hedge... So some of the drivers are impatient! But over all excellent service within 24hours on most things"
Terrible customer service. I have been waiting on a return for over. Month. Called again today and still no help. DDO NOT USE THETE CHAT TOTALLY WORTHLESS TIMES OUT BEFORE YOU GET SNY KIND OF RESPONSE.
